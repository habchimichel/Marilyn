                Dear Princess,<br><br>

                It feels like just yesterday when we embarked on this incredible journey together, yet the depth of our experiences and the richness of our love have woven a tapestry of memories that make our bond stronger with each passing day. So how about we celebrate this birthday in a different way! <br>
                I am filled with anticipation for the chapters yet to be written together. I eagerly await the adventures, the lessons, and the simple joys that life will unfold for us. Each day with you is an opportunity to continue building a future brimming with love, understanding, and shared dreams, that will certainly take place. 🌈💕<br>
                You are mu number one supporter, my bestfriend, my mother and my girlfriend! All at once! So I guess I already can say <br>MY WIFE! <br>Right?<br>
                So here's to you, my love, to the beautiful tapestry you've woven and to the countless threads of love that bind us.<br>
                Happy Birthday, and may the coming years be as magical and profound as the ones we've shared so far.<br>

                Your Beloved Future Husband!
