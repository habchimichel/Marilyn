                Dear Princess,<br><br>

                It feels like only yesterday that we began this incredible journey together. Yet, the depth of our experiences and the richness of our love have created a tapestry of memories that strengthen our bond with each passing day. So, how about celebrating this birthday a little differently? <br>
                I’m filled with anticipation for the chapters we’ve yet to write together. I look forward to the adventures, the lessons, and the simple joys life has in store for us. Each day with you is a chance to keep building a future full of love, understanding, and shared dreams, a future I know we'll make a reality. 🌈💕<br>
                You are my number one supporter, my bestfriend, my mother and my girlfriend! All at once! So I guess I already can say <br>MY WIFE! <br>Right?<br>
                So here's to you, my love, to the beautiful tapestry you've woven and to the countless threads of love that bind us.<br>
                Happy Birthday, and may the coming years be as magical and profound as the ones we've shared so far.<br>

                Your Beloved Future Husband!
            </p>
